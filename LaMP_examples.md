- ​**问题**: `What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: Ride Me Dirty is a fun, sultry, captivating story about three people finding love when they least expected it.

Catherine is a workaholic trying to make partner in her firm when her uncle passed away. In order to settle his estate she returns to a place she hasn't been to since she was child. Being back in Bridgewater reconnecting with long last friends has been a nice change of pace. It also doesn't hurt that two sexy cowboys have taken notice of her and offer her pleasure she never knew she desired.

Sam and Jack have always known they would eventually settling down the Bridgewater way, but there has never been a woman that called to them. But one look at Catherine and they know she's the one they've been waiting for.

But as Catherine's work demands her return to the big city, will she run from the life and love Sam and Jack want to provide her? Or will she leave her hectic city life and embrace love and happiness with Sam and Jack in Bridgewater?

I love Ride Me Dirty and didn't want to put it down until I had finished it, but even then I wasn't ready to let these three go. I love how Sam and Jack pursue Catherine and the whole town supports them in their efforts. Their alpha-ness is sexy and oh so mouth watering, panties don't stand a chance against all the dirty things they say. I love Catherine's feisty and sassy attitude. She's a strong, independent woman who isn't afraid to speak her mind when needed.

I would recommend this book to anyone that loves a good menage that's fast paced, witty, and down right naughty. Ride Me Dirty is quick, sultry read that will require a cold shower after you've finished.`

- ​**问题**: `Generate a title for the following abstract of a paper: Assume that a tree T has a number n
 s of “supply vertices” and all the other vertices are “demand vertices.” Each supply vertex is assigned a positive number called
 a supply, while each demand vertex is assigned a positive number called a demand. One wish to partition T into exactly n
 s subtrees by deleting edges from T so that each subtree contains exactly one supply vertex whose supply is no less than the sum of demands of all demand vertices
 in the subtree. The “partition problem” is a decision problem to ask whether T has such a partition. The “maximum partition problem” is an optimization version of the partition problem. In this paper,
 we give three algorithms for the problems. First is a linear-time algorithm for the partition problem. Second is a pseudo-polynomial-time
 algorithm for the maximum partition problem. Third is a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the maximum
 partition problem.
